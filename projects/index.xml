Playlist is determined by user&amp;rsquo;s preference on song&amp;rsquo;s emotion and user&amp;rsquo;s current location / weather factors. It is built with Python frameworks (scikit-learn, numpy, Flask) and external APIs (Spotify API, OpenWeather API). It maps songs to a specific emotion from four categories &amp;ndash; anger, happiness, sadness, and relaxed.
Gallatin uses OpenWeather API to check the weather of the user&amp;rsquo;s current location Gallatin collect training data from Spotify song objects (including danceability, valence, energy, etc) Gallatin prepares a classification machine learning algorithm by using scikit-learn and numpy library to train the model to correlate different weather factors to a specific emotion.</description></item><item><title>Disney Plus Clone</title><link>https://dk3156.github.io/dongje.kim/projects/disney/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dk3156.github.io/dongje.kim/projects/disney/</guid><description>Inspired by a youtuber&amp;rsquo;s Disney-Plus-Clone ReactJS Challenge, created a streaming platform UI with videos and films I have made in the past.
